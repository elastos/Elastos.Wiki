Elastos is a complete ecosystem of decentralized services, consisting of every component needed to support decentralized applications (dApps). However, although it was originally conceived as a self-contained and strictly secured ecosystem, the rapid growth of the blockchain space-with numerous new projects advancing decentralized finance, self-sovereign identity, and new use cases for blockchain technology - has required that Elastos rethink its role in an increasingly interoperable and multichain world.

Interwoven within our ecosystem are five key platform components, which are unique decentralized service offerings that projects can choose to integrate within their dApps.

You can navigate through the sections via the links below to learn about the components and how they each play fundamental roles in powering the Elastos ecosystem.
