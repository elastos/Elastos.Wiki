## Funding Your Account

If you wish to interact with any of Elastos' blockchains, you'll need to fund your account with some ELA.

There are several ways to obtain ELA, including from popular [exchanges](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/elastos#markets) such as Coinbase, Kucoin, Gate, and Huobi. Please note that there are three different versions of ELA (mainchain ELA, Elastos Smart Chain (ESC) ELA, and ELA on the Ethereum network); users should verify which version their chosen exchange supports before proceeeding.

To deposit assets, simply choose your desired network, chose a wallet and asset, then copy your address using the 'Receive' option.
