title: The Cyber Republic
---

Within the Elastos ecosystem, the **[Cyber Republic (CR)](https://www.cyberrepublic.org)** represents the community that helps drive governance decisions. CR is made up of ELA token holders, Elastos Foundation members, ecosystem partners, and other teams and individuals who are contributing to the network’s development and future.

The **[Cyber Republic Consensus (CRC)](https://www.cyberrepublic.org/whitepaper)** is the third pillar of the Elastos consensus engine along with PoW and DPoS. This governance system helps create a community-based voting system to influence the project’s tech and ecosystem development, resolve disputes, management community assets, develop Elastos dApps, and more.

In April 2022, The **Cyber Republic DAO** was incorporated as a legal entity in the state of Delaware, becoming a fully established LLC and thereby allowing it to conduct business activities in support of Elastos.

Overall, CR's directive is to foster decentralized community governance in the best interest of the Elastos project.

## Council

The CR Council is comprised of 12 seats which are filled by a community election conducted on the Elastos mainchain. Each councilor serves a 1-year term and elections are held annually. Councilors also act as validators of the Elastos mainchain and sidechains by operating their own supernodes and can be impeached if the community collectively deems their conduct improper.

The CR Council differs from normal councils and boards of directors in that it is a distributed body of individuals. In principle, the CR Council members do not need to know each other or have common goals because all consensus actions revolve around proposals and voting. The CR Council is a decentralized entity whose collective decision making is facilitated by blockchain.

## Proposals

Any community member with an Elastos decentralized identifier (DIDs) can submit a proposal to the Cyber Republic Consensus (CRC). A CRC proposal will normally include the following elements:

- The subject as it pertains to the CR community and Elastos technology development;
- The problem it intends to solve and the goals it aims to achieve;
- A specific method and process for reaching the goal;
- The person or team designated to implement the proposal;
- The anticipated period of time required for implementation and corresponding checkpoints; and
- A budget for expenses and an expenditure plan - if required.

After being recommended by CR Council Members, all proposals are structured as transactions recorded on the Elastos mainchain, to be voted on by CR Council members.
