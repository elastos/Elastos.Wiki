title: The Cyber Republic
---

Within the Elastos ecosystem, the **[Cyber Republic (CR)](https://www.cyberrepublic.org)** represents the community that helps drive governance decisions. CR is made up of project leaders, community members, and other teams and individuals who are contributing to the network’s development and future.

The **[Cyber Republic Consensus (CRC)](https://www.cyberrepublic.org/whitepaper)** is the third pillar of the Elastos consensus engine along with PoW and BPoS. This governance system helps create a community-based voting system to influence the project’s tech and ecosystem development, resolve disputes, management community assets, develop Elastos dApps, and more.

In April 2022, The **Cyber Republic DAO** was incorporated as a legal entity in the state of Delaware, becoming a fully established LLC and thereby allowing it to conduct business activities in support of Elastos.

Overall, CR's directive is to foster decentralized community governance in the best interest of the Elastos project.

## Council

The CR Council is comprised of 12 seats which are filled by a community election conducted on the Elastos mainchain. Each councilor serves a 1-year term and elections are held annually. Councilors also act as validators of the Elastos mainchain and sidechains by operating their own supernodes and can be impeached if the community collectively deems their conduct improper.

The CR Council differs from normal councils and boards of directors in that it is a distributed body of individuals. In principle, the CR Council members do not need to know each other or have common goals because all consensus actions revolve around proposals and voting. The CR Council is a decentralized entity whose collective decision making is facilitated by blockchain.

## Proposals

Any community member with an Elastos decentralized identifier (DIDs) can submit a proposal to the Cyber Republic Consensus (CRC). A CRC proposal will normally include the following elements:

- The subject as it pertains to the CR community and Elastos technology development;
- The problem it intends to solve and the goals it aims to achieve;
- A specific method and process for reaching the goal;
- The person or team designated to implement the proposal;
- The anticipated period of time required for implementation and corresponding checkpoints; and
- A budget for expenses and an expenditure plan - if required.

After being recommended by CR Council Members, all proposals are structured as transactions recorded on the Elastos mainchain, to be voted on by CR Council members.

### Proposal Process

1.  The user initiates a proposal application - the proposal needs to contain information, such as the purpose, plan items, and budget.
2.  CR members sign and create the proposal transaction according to the proposal information.
3.  After the proposal is on the chain, it will enter a one-week review period, and CR members will vote on the proposal.
4.  After the proposal passes the review period, it will enter the one-week referendum period. Everyone has the right to vote against the resolution of the proposal, and the proposal will be terminated if a certain number of negative votes are reached.
5.  After the proposal passes the referendum period, it can get the first budget (not all proposals have a budget).
6.  After the subsequent proposal implementation plan is completed, it's necessary to start the proposal tracking transaction according to the stage progress to declare that the stage has been completed. The tracking transaction needs to be reviewed and signed by the Secretary General, and the budget for the corresponding stage can be extracted after the tracking transaction is on the chain.

## CRC Election

The CRC election is held once a year. The voting period is one month, and the inaugural period is 12 months - both can also overlap.

### CRC Election Process

1. During the voting period, users who want to become CR are registered as candidates for CR members - the deposit is 5000 ELA.
2. During the voting period, the community can vote for CR candidates; at the end, the top 12 CR candidates will be elected.
3. After the election period begins, CR members need to claim BPoS nodes to participate in BPoS block generation within two weeks. At the end of the claim period, unclaimed BPoS nodes will become inactive and will not be able to obtain BPoS profits and participate in proposal voting until they claim BPoS nodes.
4. During the inaugural period, everyone in the community can impeach CR members; those impeached can’t participate in the proposal and BPoS voting.
5. When the number of impeached CR members reaches 5, the next round of selection will be started immediately.

### Secretary General Election

The Secretary General is responsible for tracking the implementation progress of the proposal and has the right to decide whether to issue the stage payment, according to the audit results.

The Secretary General is established at the beginning of each term upon the successfull passing of a proposal approving their appointment.
