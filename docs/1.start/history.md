title: A Brief History of Elastos
---

Since its inception, the internet was a place where individuals could interact and share data in a decentralized way, promoting newfound borderless freedom and connectivity. However, as the internet continued to evolve, corporations and **organizations began to develop applications to store and collect private user data**, taking advantage of the economic opportunities associated with such activities.

As such, **users became vulnerable to bad actors who could compromise or maintain control of their personal data and information**, which was constantly being shared and sold to other third parties for a variety of purposes.

The birth of the new internet started in 2000 when a man by the name of **Rong Chen** had just returned to China after working for Microsoft. His mission was to start his own Network Operating System, which he named Elastos in 2002. Rong was a contributor to the underlying modules of the original Windows operating system at the Microsoft headquarters. Before his time at Microsoft, Rong had studied operating systems at the University of Illinois for seven years.

But before we move too far forward, let’s put things in perspective about the year 2000. The Blackberry Pearl and Motorola Razr flip phone were the top cell phones on the market. The smartphone era hadn’t even begun. Rong’s vision to create his own secure and safe operating system was far beyond the times. He started his own company called Kortide Corp to build this operating system from scratch. For the next six years, Chen and his team would successfully incorporate a boot loader, browser, network, kernel and graphics for Elastos.

By 2007, Rong Chen had officially completed a new smartphone and had begun mass production. It just so happened that Apple came out with their own brand new phone the same year called the “iPhone”. Apple dominated this market from that point, with Android catching up in market share as well, and over the next dozen years, their reign has been unquestionably the largest. Rong’s smart phone unfortunately did not catch on, but his mission continued.

In an interview, Rong had this to say about Apple and Google, “Both Apple and Google are rich companies that we couldn’t match from a hardware and ecology standpoint. Building an operating system exceeds the capacity of a person, a company, or even a local government…. We were not prepared psychologically and financially. We also lacked hardware capabilities at that point.” Between the years of 2002–2008 Rong also developed a 3G Drive in China. This wasn’t a success, and Kortide suffered an immense blow.

Despite this, Rong and much of the Kortide team persevered and continued working on the Elastos infrastructure. New catalysts came to play from 2008 to 2016. In 2009 Rong partnered with China Unicom to use Elastos’ middleware and fertile phone operating system framework. Elastos partnered with the giant hardware manufacturer, Foxconn, in 2012. They invested $32 million with the objective to build a distributed cross-internet industrial IoT infrastructure and smart home network operating system. By 2015 Elastos created the smart router with ioeX founder Aryan Hung. When Foxconn had to pull out of its agreement due to the political climate in China and Taiwan, along with the risks involved with marketing the project and forming partnerships, Rong stated his determination, “If I’m not dying, I still have a chance”.

In 2016, Rong sought out more opportunities. He eventually discovered the emerging technology of blockchain and realized its potential when paired with the Elastos project. In January of 2017, Rong Chen connected with fellow Tsinghua University alumni, Feng Han. Rong and Feng went on to launch the Elastos Foundation in August of 2017.

Rong’s vision to build an operating system from scratch in the 2000s has evolved into a blockchain technological marvel. From the Motorola Razr flip phone to the Apple iPhone 6S+ with GPS, 4k video, and millions of apps at your disposal. While the features and other technology has taken strides in the last 20 years, **the underlying vulnerabilities of the internet have still not been addressed**. These millions of apps are all built on a flawed infrastructure, and while the road has been tough for Elastos, the principles of security and individual rights to data remain. **The monetization of a true digital economy has not been completed.**

**Elastos and the [`Cyber Republic`](/start/ecosystem/governance) is the solution to problems the digital world faces**. As digital blackmail and data theft “jobs” become more and more profitable year after year, competing to be one of the most profitable “careers” in the world, Rong’s warnings are becoming more and more potent as the digital economy is being fully centralized by multi-billion dollar corporations.

There’s never been a better time for Elastos to deliver a new internet aimed at providing full decentralization, security, and ownership of digital assets, restoring balance to what it was originally meant to be - a truly free and private ecosystem. Our vision was to enable access to digital property rights on a global scale and allow for seamless communication across networks, which remains true to this day.
