title: What is Elastos?
---

Elastos is the first open source Internet Operating System with a decentralized peer-to-peer economic infrastructure powered by blockchain. It can be used to authenticate digital rights, transfer contracts, turn digital information into assets and will serve as a new smarter and safer World Wide Web. It was founded in 2017 by Rong Chen and has built the necessary architecture to help power the future of Web3.

As a community we aim to create the most comprehensive and open Web3 ecosystem for decentralized applications and users. The Elastos design philosophy is modular in nature and includes components (blockchain, identity, storage, and communication) that when combined enable developers to build truly unstoppable peer-to-peer applications.

Our platform strives to enhance the scalability and flexbility that other networks often lack, optimized for the performance of dApps and other applications deployed on our multichain architecture that leverages Bitcoinâ€™s hashpower and DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) consensus to secure the network.

## Why Elastos?

We created Elastos to build accessible and open-source services on a global scale, allowing developers to create Web3 applications where users can truly own their own personal data and information. The foundation of our project is to enhance the user experience in Web3 in order to transcend the next wave of the internet.

### Key Features

To understand how we're making a difference in Web3, it's critical to learn about the key features that set Elastos apart from the rest.

#### Open-Source

We're a platform run by the community where anyone can help build and contribute to the underlying code, maintaining the core belief of an inclusive Web3 environment.

#### Bitcoin & Bitcoin Cash Hashrate

The Elastos Mainchain is completely decentralized by Bitcoin and the Bitcoin Cash hashrate. Given that we have an open-source blockchain that's supported by a global network of mining pools, miners don't need to deploy additional resources.

#### Elastos Smart Contract Chain (ESC)

Smart contracts written in the Solidity language can be developed and deployed on our sidechain. The ESC is an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible network that utilized a DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) consensus mechanism that's more efficient and environmentally friendly.

#### Data Ownership

By leveraging and interacting with our platform, users can create their very own DIDs that allow them to store all of their personal data that exists on Web3. This means they have complete control of their information and can choose who they want to (and don't want to) share it with.

#### Sidechain Scalability

Our DPoS Supernode network can be extended and provide consensus to various different sidechains, ultimately meaning that our entire network can horizontally scale with ease.

#### Decentralized

Blockchain, identity, storage, and other key components work in harmony on our decentralized network. Developers can build and deploy their very own dApps, where users can interact with them while owning their own data.
