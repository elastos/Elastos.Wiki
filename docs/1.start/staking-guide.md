# Elastos BPoS Guide

Elastos recently upgraded to a new Elastic Consensus mechanism which features a novel Bonded Proof of Stake (BPoS) instead of the previous Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS). In late 2021, Yipeng Su proposed the concept of BPoS to enhance the security and stability of both the Elastos main chain and its side chains. BPoS involves stakers and validators. This guide explains how to stake ELA and vote for validators in BPoS.

## Staking and Voting Guidelines

- In BPoS, users must pledge their ELA for at least 10 days or 7,200 block heights, up to a maximum of 1,000 days or 720,000 block heights.
- One staked ELA can be converted into one equity token for voting.
- Rewards depend on the amount of ELA pledged and pledge time.
- Pledge time cannot be shortened but can be extended, not exceeding the expected expiration time of the node.
- Staking profits are automatically allocated: 25% to nodes and 75% to their stakers.
- 12 CR Council nodes cannot be voted for.
- Stakers must re-vote once the pledge time ends to continue earning rewards.

## Getting Started

### Download Essentials Wallet

To participate in BPoS, download the flagship Elastos wallet, Essentials. All BPoS activities are managed through Essentials. Download the latest version for [Apple](link_to_apple) or [Android](link_to_android).

### Get ELA on the Mainchain

To participate in BPoS, users need main chain ELA for staking. You can purchase ELA on exchanges like Coinbase, Kucoin, Huobi, and Gate.io. Alternatively, use the Elastos DEX Glide Finance to buy ELA on the Elastos Smart Contract Chain (ESC). For other options, check the [Coingecko Markets page](link_to_coingecko) for ELA.

Once you have purchased ELA, transfer it to your Essentials wallet to start staking and voting. Note that ELA on Coinbase is ERC-20; follow [this guide](link_to_erc20_guide) to convert it to mainchain ELA for BPoS.
