title: "Merge Mining"
---

The Elastos blockchain utilizes merged mining with Bitcoin, the process by which consensus is reached on both chains simultaneously. In this case, the Bitcoin blockchain works as the parent blockchain to Elastos, with the Elastos chain as its auxiliary blockchain. The mining pools will deploy merged mining code and miners will submit proof of work to both blockchains at the same time. Energy consumption does not increase with merged mining, and will be equal to the energy consumed for mining either alone.

Through this mechanism, the Elastos blockchain has an extremely strong guarantee of computing power and will then be able to provide blockchain innovations at a global scale. It makes full use of existing Bitcoin computing resources in addition to being environmentally friendly. Additional benefits of merged mining include:

1. The transfer of trust over multiple chains. The Elastos main chain is merged mined along with the Bitcoin main chain. This merged mining characteristic can be extended to Elastos sidechains as long as the sidechain adopts the same proof of work consensus. Thus, layers of chains can be merged mined recursively, which establishes a hierarchy of trust among chains.

2. Isolated nodes. An auxiliary blockchain, or sidechain, dependent on merged mining does not need a consensus of multiple validator sets. In the extreme case, one chain only needs one node and does not diminish the reliability of the ledger information on the main chain or other chains. No other blockchain consensus algorithm has this kind of advantage.
