title: Elastos Architecture
---

Elastos is a complete ecosystem of decentralized services, consisting of every component needed to support decentralized applications (dApps). However, although it was originally conceived as a self-contained and strictly secured ecosystem, the rapid growth of the blockchain space-with numerous new projects advancing decentralized finance, self-sovereign identity, and new use cases for blockchain technology - has required that Elastos rethink its role in an increasingly interoperable and multichain world.

## Elastos Components

Interwoven within our ecosystem are five key platform components, which are unique decentralized service offerings that projects can choose to integrate within their dApps.

| Component                                                     | Description                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Elastos Mainchain](/learn/mainchain/intro)                   | The main security zone and transfer hub                        |
| [Elastos Smart Contract Chain (ESC)](/learn/sidechains/intro) | Specialized EVM-based sidechain for more advanced applications |
| [Decentralized Identity (DID)](/learn/dids/intro)             | Sovereign identities and verifiable credentials                |
| [Decentralized Storage (Hive)](/learn/hive/intro)             | The personal storage solutions for Elastos DIDs                |
| [Peer-to-Peer Network (Carrier)](/learn/carrier/intro)        | A P2P messaging protocol for DIDs based on Tor protocol        |
