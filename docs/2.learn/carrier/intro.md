Carrier 2.0 is in the works and will be coming in 2023 - stay tuned!
:::

Carrier is Elastos’ peer-to-peer (P2P) network that’s completely encrypted and decentralized, creating special digital certificates called Carrier IDs used to transmit and coordinate network traffic between virtual machines and dApps. This product provides secure and robust off-chain communication of data across all users within the Elastos ecosystem, making all transmissions more trustworthy and reliable.

It leverages Elastos DID and merges it with its P2P network in order to establish further security among participants through the authorization of communication, while also removing the need for IP addresses. Carrier automatically limits connections with other verified DIDs to ensure network safety for all users.
The nodes themselves are the entities that actually store information and communication exchanged by users across the network - neither the carrier nor the intermediate servers actually save or use the available data.

In summary, Carrier’s decentralized network platform allows dApps to securely connect to one another.
