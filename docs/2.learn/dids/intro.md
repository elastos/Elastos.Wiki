The Elastos Identity Chain (EID) supports the issuance of DIDs for key stakeholders and applications on Web3 - it provides DIDs for free, where each identity comes with a public/private key and unique ELA address. This sidechain is merge-mined with the Elastos mainchain and is therefore secured with Bitcoinâ€™s hashrate.
