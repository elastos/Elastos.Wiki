title: DID Backup Service
---

Backup service is a data backup service based on the specified DID identity. Users can back up the Vault data corresponding to the target DID to the Backup service after subscribing to it on the trusted Hive Node by specifying the DID identity.

Backup service will save the backup data copy of the Vault in the paired IPFS node and manage the metadata pertaining to the backup data. Users can restore the new Vault service through the backup data reconstruction in the Backup service at any time, while also continuing to provide data access services.
