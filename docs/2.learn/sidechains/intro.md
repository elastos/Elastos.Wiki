title: Elastos Sidechains
---

To reduce the pressure on the main chain and provide a better experience for decentralized applications (dApps), Elastos adopts a mainchain and sidechain hierarchical structure. The mainchain is exclusively accountable for security, governance and the circulation of ELA, while dApps operate on sidechains. The Elastos mainchain-sidechain arbitration mechanism ensures secure transfer of value through a [bidrectional anchoring mechanism](/learn/sidechains/cross-chain).

The currently [registered](/learn/sidechains/registration) sidechains are listed in the table below.

| Sidechain                                                   | Description                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Elastos Smart Contract Chain (ESC)](/learn/sidechains/ESC) | Specialized EVM-based sidechain for more advanced applications               |
| [Elastos Identity Chain (EID)](/learn/sidechains/EID)       | EVM-based sidechain custom built for issuing and managing digital identities |
