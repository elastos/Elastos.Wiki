title: Elastos Sidechains
---

To reduce the pressure on the main chain and provide a better experience for decentralized applications (dApps), Elastos adopts a mainchain and sidechain hierarchical structure. The main chain is only responsible for the circulation of ELA. dApps run on sidechains, and through the Elastos mainchain-sidechain arbitration mechanism value can be securely transfered.

At present, the online sidechains include the Elastos Smart Contract Chain (ESC) and the Elastos Identity Chain (EID).

The **Elastos Smart Contract Chain (ESC)** lets developers code and run smart contracts on Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVMs), while also leveraging a DPoS consensus mechanism to optimize scalability and speed. Developers are also able to build smart contracts written in Solidity, one of the most popular and simple coding languages available for ease of use.

The **Elastos Identity Chain (EID)** supports the issuance of DIDs for key stakeholders and applications on Web3 - it provides DIDs for free, where each identity comes with a public/private key and unique ELA address.
