title: Registering a Sidechain
---

To add a new sidechain, the user must submit a [suggestion](https://www.cyberrepublic.org/suggestion) to the [Cyber Republic](/start/governance) DAO containing basic sidechain information. It will then undergo a two-week proposal voting and referendum period. In addition, they must also submit a transaction to mainchain registering the sidechain details and successfully build it without resetting the mainchain or the cross-chain arbiter node.

If the vote passes, the cross-chain arbiter will automatically monitor and register the sidechain proposal, initiating its related transaction thread. Lastly, the sidechain registers somes additional information with the arbiter via RPC to complete its construction.
