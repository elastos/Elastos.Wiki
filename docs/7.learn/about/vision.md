We created Elastos to build accessible and open-source services on a global scale, allowing developers to create Web3 applications where users can truly own their own personal data and information. The foundation of our project is to enhance the user experience in Web3 in order to transcend the next wave of the internet.

Our team believe that by harnessing the full capabilities of what blockchain has to offer, we can truly transcend Web3 into a space that facilitates change and brings power and control back to the individual, reshaping Web2 as we know it today.
