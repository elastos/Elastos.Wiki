Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) let users have control over their own information by managing and storing identities and data. They’re verifiable identifiers stored on the blockchain operating in a completely decentralized manner, primarily used for authentication and storage purposes to not only maintain data but also protect a user’s privacy.

DIDs are known for being extremely versatile and can be used for a variety of different purposes (i.e. personal or professional ways). They’re an important stepping stone in the development of Web3, bringing privacy and ease of access to users on a global scale. 

This technology also has the following features:
-Interoperability across Web3 dApps and websites
-Ability to connect to multiple verified credentials
-Maintains privacy of personal and wallet information
-Offers secure communication between two or more parties
