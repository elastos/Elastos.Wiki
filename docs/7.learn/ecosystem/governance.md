Cyber Republic represents the decentralized governance mechanism for the Elastos ecosystem and is made up of ELA token holders, Elastos Foundation members, ecosystem partners, and other teams who are involved in helping contribute to the projectâ€™s long-term vision and success.

This governing body is important because it helps maintain decentralization across the community while acting in the best interest of all involved parties.
