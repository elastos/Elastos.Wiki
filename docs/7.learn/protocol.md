Elastos is a decentralized community aiming to create the most comprehensive and open Web3 ecosystem for dApps and users. Our project was founded in 2017 by Rong Chen and has built the necessary architecture to help power the future of Web3. 

The underlying technology behind our platform utilizes a hybrid consensus mechanism that leverages Bitcoinâ€™s hashpower and DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) to help power the network. Our platform's development code is completely open-source and made available to the entire community in our commitment to transparency.

We empower users to create wealth through the transfer and ownership of their data and digital assets, where they can benefit from features such as digital rights authentication, transferring contracts, and creating digital assets via the information on its blockchain. Digital assets such as movies, books, music, and games can be fully owned by their respective users across its new internet, removing the middleman and solidifying authenticity.


Our platform also strives to enhance the scalability and flexbility that other networks often lack, optimized for the performance of dApps and other applications deployed on our chain.
