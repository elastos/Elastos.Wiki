Elastos is a decentralized community aiming to create the most comprehensive and open Web3 ecosystem for dApps and users. Our project was founded in 2017 by Rong Chen and has built the necessary architecture to help power the future of Web3. 

The underlying technology behind our platform utilizes a hybrid consensus mechanism that leverages Bitcoinâ€™s hashpower and DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) to help power the network. Our platform's development code is completely open-source and made available to the entire community in our commitment to transparency.

Our platform also strives to enhance the scalability and flexbility that other networks often lack, optimized for the performance of dApps and other applications deployed on our chain.
