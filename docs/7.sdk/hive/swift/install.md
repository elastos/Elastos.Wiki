## Build from source

Use the following commands to download and build source code:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/elastos/Elastos.NET.Hive.Swift.SDK
$ cd Elastos.NET.Hive.Swift.SDK
$ pod install
$ open -a Xcode ElastosHiveSDK.xcworkspace
```

> Note: Different versions of CocoaPods will lead to compilation errors. Please keep the latest version. Use the following commands to update CocoaPods.

```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

Then use the Apple Xcode to build ElastosHiveSDK target and generate ElastosHiveSDK.framework.

### Getting Started

Open the ElastosHiveSDK.xcworkspace and Select TestHost target to run unit tests. Then press Command-6 to open the Test navigator. There are three ways to run the tests:

1. Product ▸ Test or Command-U. Both of these run all test classes.
2. Click the arrow button in the Test navigator.
3. Click the diamond button in the gutter.

You can alse run an individual test method by clicking its diamond, either in the Test navigator or in the gutter.

When all the tests succeed, the diamonds will turn green and show checkmarks.

## CocoaPods

### Pod Installation

The distribution would be published to the CocoaPods platform. So, the simple way to use ElastosHiveSDK.framework is to add the following line to your Podfile:

```bash
$ pod 'ElastosHiveSDK'
```

Then run the command below to install it before open your Xcode workspace:

```bash
$ pod install
```
