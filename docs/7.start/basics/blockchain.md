## What is blockchain?

The blockchain is a distributed database that keeps an ongoing list of records called blocks, which are connected using cryptography. Moreover, it's a decentralized and public ledger that contains a list of transactions executed using cryptocurrencies, setting the foundation for how these digital assets operate and are stored. A blockchain ledger is immutable and therefore cannot be altered, keeping a permanent historical record of all activity. 


## Use Cases

So what exactly can the blockchain be used for? There are various use cases that are revolutionizing the way people and businesses use money and data today, such as payment processing, transferring assets, supply chain monitoring, sharing data, healthcare, and much more. The permissionless nature of the blockchain enables transaction execution to be much smoother and faster.
