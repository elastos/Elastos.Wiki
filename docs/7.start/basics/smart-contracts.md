Smart contracts are programs stored on the blockchain that help automate transactions and execute actions based on specific requirements or conditions. They're essentially computer programs that automate the facilitation and execution of network agreements, removing the need for an intermediary or middleman while allowing the chain to become independent.

For example, if a buyer and seller on the Elastos blockchain through code, a smart contract could execute the transaction based on those criteria. By using smart contracts, transactions are transparent, automatic, and irreversible, creating the underlying foundation for what blockchains are meant to do.
