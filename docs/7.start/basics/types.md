There are 4 different types of blockchains that exist today - let's take a quick look at each of their characteristics. 

## Public

A public blockchain is the most well-known type of  distributed ledger technology, provide a decentralized, permissionless, and secure solution when executing transactions and activities with digital asset. All of the information/data on a public blockchain is disseminated across a P2P (peer-to-peer) network and verified through different consensus mechanisms (either PoW or PoS).

## Private

A private blockchain operates in a more siloed manner (or is controlled by 1 entity). It's similar to a public blockchain when it comes P2P transactions and decentralization but runs in a smaller environment, typically within a company or enterprise.

## Hybrid

A hybrid blockchain has a blend of characteristics from public and private blockchains. By implementing a hybrid blockchain model, companies can deploy private and permissioned systems simultaneously with a public permissionless one, restricting access to certain users when it comes to viewership and control of the data.

## Consortium

A consortium blockchain has a mix of both private and public blockchain features but involves multiple parties within a company working together within a decentralized environment. It's moreso like a private blockchain network but with limited access to certain people or groups, which helps remove risks if only 1 organization has control of the entire network.
