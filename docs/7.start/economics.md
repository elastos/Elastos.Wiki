Inflation Design

ELA is the Elastos native token and is primarily used to store information on the DID sidechain, process network payments, and trade goods and services across the network. It plays different roles across the network’s different chains - on the ESC sidechain, it functions as Ethereum for payments and smart contract computations; on the DID sidechain, it’s used to update identity data, register new identities, and more.

The total circulating supply of ELA is around 19.8 million tokens, where the amount in circulation is programmed to increase by 1.32 million ELA each year to maintain pace with inflation and other purposes. The token can also be used for staking, where users can run their own supernodes on the network in order to earn passive income rewards.
