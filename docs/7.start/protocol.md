sidebar_label: ⭐ What is Elastos?
---

Elastos is a decentralized community aiming to create the most comprehensive and open Web3 ecosystem for dApps and users. Our project was founded in 2017 by Rong Chen and has built the necessary architecture to help power the future of Web3.

The underlying technology behind our platform utilizes a hybrid consensus mechanism that leverages Bitcoin’s hashpower and DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) to help secure the network. Our platform's development code is completely open-source and made available to the entire community in our commitment to transparency.

Elastos empowers users to create wealth through the transfer and ownership of their data and digital assets, where they can benefit from features such as digital rights authentication, transferring contracts, and creating digital assets via the information on its blockchain. Digital assets such as movies, books, music, and games can be fully owned by their respective users across its new internet, removing the middleman and solidifying authenticity.

Our platform also strives to enhance the scalability and flexbility that other networks often lack, optimized for the performance of dApps and other applications deployed on our chain.

## Mission & Vision

We created Elastos to build accessible and open-source services on a global scale, allowing developers to create Web3 applications where users can truly own their own personal data and information. The foundation of our project is to enhance the user experience in Web3 in order to transcend the next wave of the internet.

Our teams believe that by harnessing the full capabilities of what blockchain has to offer, we can truly transcend Web3 into a space that facilitates change and brings power and control back to the individual, reshaping Web2 as we know it today.

## Key Features

To understand how we're making a difference in Web3, it's critical to learn about the key features that set Elastos apart from the rest.

#### Open-Source

We're a platform run by the community where anyone can help build and contribute to the underlying code, maintaining the core belief of an inclusive Web3 environment.

#### Bitcoin & Bitcoin Cash Hashrate

The Elastos Mainchain is completely decentralized by Bitcoin and the Bitcoin Cash hashrate. Given that we have an open-source blockchain that's supported by a global network of mining pools, miners don't need to deploy additional resources.

#### Elastos Smart Contract Chain (ESC)

Smart contracts written in the Solidity language can be developed and deployed on our sidechain. The ESC is an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible network that utilized a DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) consensus mechanism that's more efficient and environmentally friendly.

#### Data Ownership

By leveraging and interacting with our platform, users can create their very own DIDs that allow them to store all of their personal data that exists on Web3. This means they have complete control of their information and can choose who they want to (and don't want to) share it with.

#### Sidechain Scalability

Our DPoS Supernode network can be extended and provide consensus to various different sidechains, ultimately meaning that our entire network can horizontally scale with ease.

#### Decentralized

Blockchain, identity, storage, and other key components work in harmony on our decentralized network. Developers can build and deploy their very own dApps, where users can interact with them while owning their own data.
